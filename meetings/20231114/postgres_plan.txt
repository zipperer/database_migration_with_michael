Will first try using postgres.
[can also try sqlite]

install postgres
-- apt-get install postgresql-12
-- https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/

install tableplus
-- https://tableplus.com/linux

identify each table that we want in postgres.

for each table, we will export a csv for the table.
- include column names, column type

for each table, create a table with the required columns.
- I will draft versions of this given the csvs shared in advance

import from csv into postgres.
